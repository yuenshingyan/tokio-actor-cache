    // High-Value Functionality
    // 1. Cache Expiration Policies
    // Support multiple expiration policies (e.g., Least Recently Used, Least Frequently Used, all-keys-random) to control which objects are evicted under memory pressure.
    // Allow setting global and per-key TTL (time to live).

    // 2. Advanced Caching Patterns
    // Cache-Aside Pattern: Facilitate application-side loading and updating of cache entries.
    // Read-Through and Write-Through: Automate cache population and updates on misses/hits and writes, reducing logic in client code and keeping cached data consistent.
    // Write-Behind: Optionally support background updates to the underlying data store, batching or delaying disk/database writes.

    // 3. Persistence Support
    // Add options to persist cached data to disk, e.g., periodic snapshots or append-only logs, to recover from crashes or restarts.

    // 4. Cache Invalidation and Pub/Sub
    // Implement mechanisms to propagate invalidation messages (Pub/Sub) to synchronize cache state across multiple replicas or instances.

    // 5. Metrics and Monitoring
    // Track cache hits/misses, evictions, memory usage, and performance statistics for effective monitoring and tuning.

    // 6. Cluster and Distribution Support
    // Facilitate sharding or consistent hashing to distribute cache data across multiple nodes for scalability.
    // Add partitioning and replication to support high availability and resilience.

    // 7. Near Cache (Local Caching)
    // Implement an optional per-process or per-node local cache to speed up repetitive reads and reduce network hops, mirroring near cache designs in high-performance systems.
